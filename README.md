# WeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2. It is an app that will show the minimum, maximum temperature, humitidity and wind speed. The data is pulled in from Open Weather API - https://rapidapi.com/KirylBokiy/api/openweather43/

This is my first project created with Angular and the goal is to get first experience with this open source, JavaScript framework that's built on TypeScript.

## How to View the project

To view the project, you can perform the below

git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/WeatherApp.git

 Run `ng serve -o` on the terminal. This will navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
